for using this app you can get input from shel or it can get it from file if input bind to app in shel. for get input from file, the last paragraph of file must end with $ charecter.

i found best coeficient and put them in result2. must of them are good but the last items normaly behave better than others and because of this for run i use the last coeficient

for get result now it read coeficiency from last line of result2 file. if you want to change it you must change parameter of set_mul() function.

it has ability for searching to find best coeficiency by iterating them in search_for_best_mul() function. if expexted parameter send to it it check result of execution with expexted result and with don't get this parameter it only run check and show result of run.

NOTICE!!!
this app has very long time for initializing ctcclass but after that it  has good speed.
